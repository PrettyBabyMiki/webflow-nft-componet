### How to add "Connect wallet" button?
Mint button will ask to connect wallet, so it's not necessary to add a "Connect wallet" button.

If you still want to do it, create a Webflow button with ID `connect`.

### How to use this with Polygon, Binance, or other Ethereum-based networks?
It's easy! Change `NETWORK_ID` in the code snippet:

- Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet: `NETWORK_ID = 4`
- Polygon `NETWORK_ID = 137`
- Binance `NETWORK_ID = 56`
- For others visit: https://chainlist.org/
5. Change `NETWORK_ID` if you're using something other than Ethereum:
   - Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet: `NETWORK_ID = 4`
   - Polygon `NETWORK_ID = 137`
   - Binance `NETWORK_ID = 56`
6. Create a button with ID `mint-button` to your Webflow site.
7. You're done ðŸŽ‰

Minting will work via Metamask wallet, and will ask to connect the wallet first, so it's not necessary to add a "Connect wallet" button.
